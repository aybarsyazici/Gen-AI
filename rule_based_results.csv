Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute mushrooms, zucchini, artichokes, onion, carrot, celery, broccoli, peppers, and wine; cook for 7 minutes or until vegetables are tender. 

Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in flour, salt, pepper, crushed red pepper; cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Whisk in milk, stirring frequently until the sauce thickens, approximately 10 minutes. 

Pour the sauce over the vegetable mixture; combine. 

TO ASSEMBLE: Spread 1 tablespoon oil over the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Spread 1/4 of the vegetable mixture in the dish; top with 3 lasagna sheets. Repeat the layers twice; spread the remaining vegetable mixture on top. 

Sprinkle with cheese; cover with aluminum foil. Bake for 25 minutes or until bubbly. Let it stand for 10 minutes before cutting.

Cake: Position rack in center of your oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour two 8"" cake pans, lining the bottom of the pans with parchment paper and greasing that as well. Combine cocoa powder and semisweet chocolate in a medium bowl. Pour 1/2 cup boiling water over cocoa powder and chocolate and whisk until smooth. Whisk in buttermilk. Set mixture aside. Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt in another medium bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat brown sugar and butter in a large bowl until well blended. Add eggs and vanilla and beat until light and creamy. Beat in dry ingredients and chocolate mixture. Transfer to prepared pans, dividing equally between the two pans. Bake until a tester comes out clean 20-25 minutes. Cool cakes in pans for 15 minutes, then cut around pan sides to loosen cakes before turning out onto racks. Peel off parchment paper and cool completely.

Icing: Combine cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, vanilla and a dash of salt in a mixing bowl and mix until light and fluffy. Reserve a few strawberries for garnish if you'd like. Stem the rest of the strawberries and slice them in half. Place in a bowl and sprinkle with 4 Tablespoons of granulated sugar. Stir together and let sit for 30 minutes. Divide the marinated strawberries in half and mash up both bowls with a fork (you don't have to make it a pulp, you can leave some pieces mostly whole). Sprinkle each bowl with 1 Tablespoon of sugar and let sit for another 30 minutes.

Assembly: Place one layer of chocolate cake on serving platter or plate. Top with half of the mashed strawberries. Spread a little less than 1/3 of the icing over the strawberries. Place second cake layer on top. Put the rest of the mashed strawberries on top of the cake. Add half of the remaining icing and spread over strawberries. Use the remaining frosting to ice the sides of the cake. If you kept some strawberries whole, you can slice them and use to garnish the cake. Store cake in the fridge and serve slightly chilled.

Grilled Rack Of Lamb With A Port Wine Fig Sauce

Ingredients:
- Rack of lamb
- Marinade:
  - Olive oil
  - Garlic cloves, minced
  - Fresh rosemary, chopped
  - Salt and pepper to taste
- Fig Sauce:
  - Fresh figs, halved
  - Olive oil
  - Shallots, minced
  - Garlic cloves, minced
  - Fresh rosemary, chopped
  - Port wine
  - Chicken broth
  - Butter
  - Balsamic vinegar
- Optional sides:
  - Mashed parsnips and potatoes
  - Roasted spuds
  - Fresh sauteed kale
  - Roasted brussels sprouts with walnut butter

Instructions:
1. In a bowl, mix together the olive oil, minced garlic, chopped rosemary, salt, and pepper to make the marinade.
2. Rub the marinade over the rack of lamb, ensuring it is well coated. Place the lamb in a large baggie, seal it, and let it marinate overnight in the refrigerator.
3. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.
4. In a small saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced shallots, minced garlic, chopped rosemary, and quartered figs. Cook for about 5 minutes until the figs are soft.
5. Add the port wine and chicken broth to the saucepan. Simmer the mixture on low/medium heat until it is reduced by about half, approximately 10 minutes. The sauce will thicken on its own.
6. While the sauce is simmering, grill the marinated rack of lamb. Place the lamb on the grill and cook for about 5 minutes per side until it is nicely browned with a good crust. Flip the lamb and continue grilling for another 5 minutes on indirect heat until it reaches an internal temperature of 120 degrees Fahrenheit for medium-rare. If you prefer a rarer lamb, remove it from the grill a bit earlier.
7. Once the lamb is cooked to your desired doneness, remove it from the grill and cover it with foil. Let it rest for 10-15 minutes before carving.
8. Add the remaining fresh figs to the reduced sauce to heat them up. Stir in the butter and a dash of balsamic vinegar.
9. Serve the grilled rack of lamb with the fig sauce. Plate 2-3 chops per plate and drizzle the sauce over the lamb. Optionally, serve with mashed parsnips and potatoes or roasted spuds. Pair with fresh sauteed kale or roasted brussels sprouts with walnut butter.
